        <h2>Problem statement: Gmail Spam</h2>
        <p>
          Gmail users get spammed with too many emails that clutter their inboxes and makes it difficult for them to distinguish their important emails from trivial ones.

        <p>
          Richard Harbison is a 33 year old married man with 2 children. 
          He is an entrepreneur that is taking risks and reaching out to investors to expand his buisness.
          Therefore it is vital for his business related emails to be accesible and seperate from things like an invitation to his daughter's ballet recital.

        <p>
          Richard is determined to lock down a deal with a possible investor. He wants to use his gmail to review business plans with his investor, but it's not easy.
          His son's progress reports from school, his daughter's dance recital invitation, and even brochures for a fmaily vacation are cluttering up his gmail. 
          This makes it harder to find the very urgent emails from his investor. He uses our app to separate his emails based on importance and secures the deal with his investor.
