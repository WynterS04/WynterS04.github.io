          Richard Harbison is a 33 year old married man with 2 children. 
          He is an entreprenuer that is taking risks and reaching out to investors to expand his buisness.
          Therefore it is vital for his business related emails to be accesible and seperate from things like an invitation to his daughter's ballet recital.
